# BusInfo

A program made during a boring lunch break at work.

## How to set up

Launch BusInfo.exe, right-click on the tray icon, and choose Settings.

Enter the timetable of your commute, as well as the time to start notifying, and the time it takes you to get to the bus stop.

Click "Save", and optionally create a shortcut in `shell:startup` to have BusInfo run whenever you log in to Windows.

## How to use

Just wait for it.

## Todos?

* Maybe something better than a popup balloon
* Show one past and 2 future buses as well
